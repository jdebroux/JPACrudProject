## Sping/MVC JPA CRUD Project

Individual homework for Skill Distillery
week 9

### Overview

Welcome to Song Database!

In this full stack development project you will be able to access a song database and search for songs by either ID or keyword.  If you search by keyword, it will search all artists, albums, and titles for that keyword.

You will also have the option to add a song to the database, edit a song already in the database, or delete a song entirely.  This was my first full stack project with Spring functionality, and the first project where I created a database from scratch.  Test it out!

### Lessons Learned

This project was a little easier to an MVP up and running, so I focused on my weaker areas for my stretch goals to better strengthen those skills.  I added a navigation bar to the top of each page to improve the user experience.  I also utilized bootstrap and css quite a bit more to spice the project up a bit.

### Attack Plan

Starting this project, I first used MySQL Workbench to create a database and a table within it.  After that was created, I was able to turn to the Java side of things and create an JPA project with entities, as well as tests for those entities.

Next I created a BootMVC project where Spring would live and mapped it so that it could access my JPA project.  Once all the mapping of projects was done, I was able to create JSP pages, my controller, and my DAOImplementation.  

After all of the mapping was completed, I was able to spend a lot of my time focusing on Bootstrap and CSS to beautify the project on the browser side of things.  I finished the project by re-looking everything over and searching for any bugs.
